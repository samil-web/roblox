I need to create new kind of experience for the roblox students they will be able to practice as in scrimba.

What is unique about scrimba:

Breakdown of topics

Realtime interaction w/lesson

Challenges in the middle of lesson

Ask students which games they like - create custom plan

Find great examples for the lesson explanations

Create bite sized lessons before every lesson w/ learning objective

Explain why we use each concept and what would happen w/out it

Curriculum :

Lesson 1 - Intro, Events

Lesson 2 - Property change example w/ first module all concepts

Lesson 3 - Data types.- boolean, string, number

Lesson 4 - Variables

 Lesson 5- changing properties of object w/ script

Lesson 6- Functions

Lesson 7- math, parameters, arguments, return

Lesson 8 - if statement

Take a little game project and move towards it going through these topics , in each topic kids should build something
