# Roblox Scripting Curriculum for 10-11 Year Olds

## Building on Minecraft Coding Experience

Based on your students' background with Minecraft coding and the weekly class format, I've developed a curriculum that focuses on scripting while building toward complete games. This plan leverages their existing programming knowledge while introducing Roblox-specific concepts through fun, engaging projects.

### Module 1: From Minecraft to Roblox (3 Weeks)

**Week 1: Roblox Studio & Basic Scripting**

* **Mini-Project:** "Magic Click Detector"
  * Build on your growing block example
  * Add color changes and sound effects when clicked
  * Compare to Minecraft agent commands: "Instead of telling an agent to move, we're telling a part to grow!"

**Week 2: Variables & Properties**

* **Mini-Project:** "Day/Night Cycle Button"
  * Create a button that toggles between day and night
  * Use variables to track current state (day vs. night)
  * Change lighting, sky, and ambient sounds

**Week 3: Functions & Events**

* **Mini-Project:** "Teleporting Door"
  * Create a door that teleports the player to a different location when touched
  * Use functions to organize teleportation code
  * Connect TouchEntered event to function calls

**Module Project:** "Magical Treehouse" - Combine all three mini-projects into a small playable area with interactive elements

### Module 2: Creating Game Mechanics (4 Weeks)

**Week 4: Loops & Timers**

* **Mini-Project:** "Obstacle Course Timer"
  * Create a course with start/finish lines
  * Use loops to create multiple obstacles
  * Display timer that counts up while playing

**Week 5: Conditional Statements**

* **Mini-Project:** "Weather Machine"
  * Create a control panel with buttons for different weather types
  * Use if/then statements to change particles, lighting, and sounds
  * Add random weather changes if no button is pressed for 30 seconds

**Week 6: Tables & Collections**

* **Mini-Project:** "Treasure Hunt"
  * Create collectible coins throughout a small level
  * Store coins in a table and track collection progress
  * Reveal a secret door when all coins are collected

**Week 7: Player Stats & GUI**

* **Mini-Project:** "Health & Energy System"
  * Create GUI elements showing health and energy bars
  * Add objects that increase/decrease stats when touched
  * Show game over screen when health reaches zero

**Module Project:** "Obstacle Adventure" - Create a small game combining timing challenges, collectibles, and player stats

### Module 3: Advanced Interactions (4 Weeks)

**Week 8: NPC Characters**

* **Mini-Project:** "Friendly Robot"
  * Create an NPC that follows the player
  * Add proximity chat dialog system
  * Program simple pathfinding around obstacles

**Week 9: Tool Creation**

* **Mini-Project:** "Magic Wand"
  * Create an equippable wand tool
  * Add particle effects on activation
  * Implement different spell effects

**Week 10: Physics & Forces**

* **Mini-Project:** "Rocket Launcher"
  * Create a physical projectile system
  * Add explosion effects and forces
  * Implement cooldown timer between launches

**Week 11: Save Data**

* **Mini-Project:** "High Score Board"
  * Create a persistent leaderboard for a simple game
  * Store player names and scores
  * Sort and display top 5 players

**Module Project:** "Wizard Academy" - A game where players learn spells, interact with NPCs, and compete in challenges

### Final Project (3+ Weeks)

**Weeks 12-14+: Complete Game Development**

* Students work in pairs to design and develop a complete game
* Incorporates multiple mechanics from previous modules
* Includes planning, development, testing, and publishing phases
* Options could include:
  * Obstacle course/parkour game
  * Collect-a-thon adventure
  * Simple role-playing experience
  * Tycoon-style game

## Teaching Approach

Given your students' age and that they'll be working in pairs, here's how I'd structure each lesson:

1. **Start with Visual Connection** (5-10 min)
   * Begin by showing a popular Roblox game that uses the day's concept
   * Discuss how the code might work behind the scenes
2. **Guided Coding** (15-20 min)
   * Code along with clear, step-by-step instructions
   * Use your visualization approach to explain what each line does
   * Emphasize connections to Minecraft concepts they already know
3. **Pair Experimentation** (15-20 min)
   * Give students challenges to modify the example
   * Encourage one student to be the "coder" and one to be the "reviewer"
   * Have them switch roles halfway through
4. **Share & Celebrate** (5-10 min)
   * Have pairs show their creations
   * Discuss what worked/challenges faced
   * Preview next week's topic

## Recommended Roblox Features to Focus On

For 10-11 year old boys learning Roblox scripting, these features tend to be especially engaging:

1. **Character customization** - Allowing players to change appearance
2. **Environmental effects** - Weather, day/night cycles, particles
3. **Collectible systems** - Item gathering with rewards
4. **Simple combat** - Basic weapons and health systems
5. **Movement mechanics** - Special jumps, speed boosts, flying
6. **Interactive objects** - Buttons, levers, doors, teleporters

## Scaffolding & Support

Since they'll be working in pairs on computers/iPads:

1. **Create cheat sheets** with common Roblox Studio commands and script patterns
2. **Provide template places** with basic assets already set up
3. **Use commenting heavily** in example scripts to explain each section
4. **Create video tutorials** they can reference between classes
5. **Establish debugging steps** like checking the output window for errors
