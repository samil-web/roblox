- Different data types (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Variable naming best practices

**Activities:**
1. **Evidence Tag System**: Create variables to store suspect names, evidence types, and case numbers
2. **Detective Profile**: Build a character profile using variables for name, badge number, and specialization
3. **Case File Setup**: Initialize variables for tracking investigation progress

**Building Challenge:**
Create a physical evidence locker in Roblox with labeled storage compartments that correspond to different variable types.

**Assessment:**
- Can students create and name variables appropriately?
- Do they understand the concept of storing information?
- Can they retrieve and display variable values?

## 🔍 **DAY 2: Conditionals - The Lie Detector**
### Story Chapter: "Following the First Leads"

**Learning Objectives:**
- Master if/then/else logic
- Understand boolean conditions
- Learn comparison operators

**Mystery Plot:**
Three suspects have been identified: Dr. Syntax (the programmer), Sneaky Pete (the janitor), and Ms. Binary (the IT administrator). Students must interrogate each suspect using logical questioning.

**Programming Concepts:**
- If statements and else clauses
- Comparison operators (==, >, <, !=)
- Boolean logic (and, or, not)
- Nested conditionals

**Activities:**
1. **Suspect Interrogation**: Create branching dialogue trees based on suspect responses
2. **Alibi Checker**: Verify suspect alibis using conditional logic
3. **Evidence Analyzer**: Determine if evidence points to guilt or innocence

**Building Challenge:**
Build an interactive interrogation room with lie detector equipment that responds to different inputs with visual and audio feedback.

**Assessment:**
- Can students write proper if/else statements?
- Do they understand when to use different comparison operators?
- Can they create logical decision trees?

## 🔄 **DAY 3: Loops - The Security System**
### Story Chapter: "Analyzing Patterns and Clues"

**Learning Objectives:**
- Master while loops and for loops
- Understand when to use different loop types
- Learn loop control and avoiding infinite loops

**Mystery Plot:**
Security footage from 24 cameras needs analysis. Students discover the thief has been casing the academy for weeks, following a specific pattern. They must use loops to scan footage and identify the pattern.

**Programming Concepts:**
- While loops for unknown iterations
- For loops for known iterations
- Loop counters and conditions
- Breaking out of loops

**Activities:**
1. **Footage Scanner**: Use while loops to scan through hours of security footage
2. **Pattern Detector**: Use for loops to check specific time intervals
3. **Evidence Counter**: Count different types of evidence using loop counters

**Building Challenge:**
Create a security monitoring station with multiple screens that automatically cycle through camera feeds using loops.

**Assessment:**
- Can students choose the appropriate loop type for different tasks?
- Do they understand loop conditions and counters?
- Can they avoid infinite loops?

## ⚙️ **DAY 4: Functions - The Detective Toolkit**
### Story Chapter: "Building Advanced Investigation Tools"

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand functions as reusable code blocks
- Learn parameters and return values
- Practice function organization and naming

**Mystery Plot:**
The investigation is getting complex. Students need specialized tools: a fingerprint analyzer, a code decryptor, and a timeline reconstructor. Each tool needs to be built as a function that can be used multiple times.

**Programming Concepts:**
- Function definition and calling
- Parameters and arguments
- Return values
- Function scope and local variables

**Activities:**
1. **Fingerprint Analyzer**: Function that takes fingerprint data and returns match probability
2. **Code Decryptor**: Function that decodes stolen code fragments
3. **Timeline Builder**: Function that organizes events chronologically

**Building Challenge:**
Create a high-tech laboratory with interactive detective tools. Each tool is a function that students can activate with different inputs.

**Assessment:**
- Can students write functions with proper parameters?
- Do they understand return values and how to use them?
- Can they organize code into logical, reusable functions?

## 🎯 **DAY 5: Integration - The Final Confrontation**
### Story Chapter: "Catching the Code Thief"

**Learning Objectives:**
- Combine all programming concepts
- Apply problem-solving skills
- Debug and optimize code

**Mystery Plot:**
All evidence points to the real culprit. Students must build an automated trap system that uses all their programming skills: variables to track the thief's location, conditionals to trigger alarms, loops to monitor continuously, and functions to coordinate the capture.

**Programming Concepts:**
- Integration of variables, conditionals, loops, and functions
- Code organization and structure
- Debugging techniques
- Problem decomposition

**Activities:**
1. **Trap Coordinator**: Master function that calls all other systems
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous loop that tracks thief movement
3. **Alert System**: Conditional triggers for different threat levels
4. **Evidence Compilation**: Final report generation using all collected data

**Building Challenge:**
Create the ultimate detective command center with automated systems, real-time displays, and interactive controls that demonstrate all learned concepts working together.

**Assessment:**
- Can students integrate multiple programming concepts?
- Do they demonstrate problem-solving and debugging skills?
- Can they explain how each concept contributes to the solution?
